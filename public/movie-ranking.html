<h1>The Best Movies According to Ayaka</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr/>

<h3>Harry Potter</h3>
<p>The first time I watched it was when I was in elementary school. I was crazy about the story and visual effects. You can have the experience of entering a magical world.</p>

<h3>La La Land</h3>
<p>This movie taught me how difficult it is to pursue your dreams and be in love at the same time. The ending of the story is sad, but realistic and beautiful.</p>

<h3>Monsters Inc</h3>
<p>The story is interesting and original. The message of the film is that laughter has more energy than fear, which is great. The balance between funny and heartwarming is perfect.</p>
